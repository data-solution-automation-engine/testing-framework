## To do

- Write a wrapper for  DIRECT (in TSQL), requires installing and using DIRECT (OMD but a bit more  generic)
- Documenting existing project and tSQLt test cases in the documentation library
- Updating the templates to suit the generic model (a more reusable model is defined, and templates must be updated to read/write against this model)
- Create a database project for the testing framework
- Perhaps rewrite some of the tSQLt functionality such as AssertEquals as a function
